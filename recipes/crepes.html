    <h4>About the recipe</h4>
    <p>Delicate crepes always create an impressive display, but making them is 
        surprisingly easy. And because they play well with both sweet and 
        savory fillngs, these super-thin French pancakes are versatile enough
        to serve for breakfast,lunch, dinner and dessert.</p> 
    
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of milk</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First beat the eggs like they owe you money then 
            mix in with flour until soft. It will start off kind of 
            thick but should soften up more the more you mix.
        </li>
        <li>Next you want to melt the butter in the microwave for about 
            30 seconds then quickly add and mix into your batter so it doesn't
            harden.
        </li>
        <li>Now you want mix the milk in starting with half a cup so it doesn't
            splash everywhere, then pour in the rest. The batter should be very 
        watery.  </li>
        <li>Optional but you can add 2 tbsp of vanilla for extra sweetness.</li>
        <li>Now it's time to start cooking! Use a pan on medium heat 
            and use a 1/4 cup to pour batter into the pan. </li>
            <ul>
                <li>You want the crepe to be thin to have the right texture</li>
                <li>It's also good to get the heat and timing right when flipping the crepe</li>
            </ul>
        <li>You know it's ready to flip when you see the edges start to turn brown.</li>
